# <span style="color:red">this is who i am:</span> 
hello, I’m Seleya, 24 years old from Hamburg. I’m currently studying Digital Media, with my minor in Popular Music Studies. 
Creativity and expression have always played a big role in my life, whether through visuals or sound.
I'm someone who finds energy in the little things, music being one of the biggest. Concerts, for me, are more than just shows: they’re shared moments of sound, emotion, and connection. There's something so special about being surrounded by people who feel the same way as you do. It’s in those moments, when the lights drop and the first note hits—this is where I feel most alive.
